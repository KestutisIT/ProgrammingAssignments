Please refer to the Media RSS feed at this URL: http://vodo.net/feeds/public

Create a single web page which consumes this feed and presents it as an attractive list of well-formatted feed entries, including item metadata.

Create a PHP script which consumes the MRSS feed and outputs JSON, then write a JavaScript front end to consume and render the JSON. 

When the user clicks on a particular feed entry in the list, they should be presented with a "detail view" for that entry including more complete metadata. Use your judgment to come up with a usable solution.

Feel free to make use of existing libraries which might be helpful.

Be advised that your solution will be graded based on simplicity, maintainability, and use of appropriate markup.
